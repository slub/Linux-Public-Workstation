# Linux Public Workstation

This repo contains the necessary scripts and [installation instructions](INSTALL.md) for setting up a Linux-based public workstation as used for the public computers in the SLUB ("Öffentlichkeitsplätze").

- instructions for setting up a network boot server (no local OS is installed on the clients to prevent manipulations)
- startup and logon scripts (automatic logout and profile reset after x minutes)
- various config files (system-wide settings and user defaults)
